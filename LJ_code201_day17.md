# LJ Code 201 Day - 17

“Tell me and I forget Teach me and I remember. Involve me and I learn.”

UX step by step

Intro text appears?

User hits enter?

First Scenerio appears – nothing but array, data is an array, (really long strings). When user press enter, grab first item from the array:
1)user press enter
2)pull first item from scenario array] single Function that is method and keep track of this, on submit, have incrementor
3)append 1st scenario to the DOM
4)create an append our text input..
•	Create another array, refactor
5)user types text, presses enter --- another set of




Every single object represents a question with a series of answers.

Object has a question and answer or series of answers. Do this in an array… for each question it will be easier to grab



Create a constructor: Object that contains questions and all data that’s an array, pass in point values, then the correct answer.

Questions = [‘q1’,’q2’,’q3’,’q4’];
Var s1 = new Scenario (‘question’ ‘answer’); for every answer have a point value. Counter sitting in the background
mvp status +5-5……….
