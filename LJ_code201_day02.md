# LJ Code 201 Day - 2

“Tell me and I forget Teach me and I remember. Involve me and I learn.”

"Lets GIT IT"

Today I learned how to navigate the terminal. Also, we got more in depth information with using Git and Github. Specifically, uploading pages to the GitHub.

We also learned how to apply Javascript using different documents. I also learned how to use Javascript within a html file.

The review with Semantic Markup help me as well. Block , Inline: You can change the format but its always going to start a new line and to the left.
