# LJ Code 201 Day - 9

“Tell me and I forget Teach me and I remember. Involve me and I learn.”

Today we discussed advanced layouts in Css and how we could access resources to make our page standout.

A few things to keep in mind:

Width is everything. Height is an artifact of container and content.
Gotta know your pixels. This is a MUST.
Learning to eyeball pixels makes you much more efficient in building layout.

We also discussed block, inline, and display settings.

Positioning is complicated.....
  absolute lets you move/offset an element from the position it would occupy in normal flow
  fixed is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled.
  relative lets you move/offset an element from the position it would occupy in normal flow

CSS frameworks

Imagine if someone built a CSS template that you could easily manipulate and just put content into... a template that would set up your basic styles and layouts?

Well, lots of someones have done that, and there's a lot of CSS frameworks out there. At this stage in your development, you'll hinder your growth by relying on CSS frameworks to do your work for you. You need to understand how things work. That said, you should go look at some of the ones listed in this tutorial, and also take a look at Skeleton, which is a personal favorite.

Note: You are not allowed to use CSS frameworks for your work in this course, and I expect that their use is strongly discouraged in Code 301. But by the time you get to 401, you can use them.
