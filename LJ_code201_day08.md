# LJ Code 201 Day - 8

“Tell me and I forget Teach me and I remember. Involve me and I learn.”

Today in class we discussed the general construction of a webpage.

How to organize from a micro sense?
'use strict'

declare all your global variables
constructors you may be using
create instances
*******This is setting up the data

function declaration is next...
  global functions
  event handlers
*******Setting up your functionality/behavior

call any functions needed on load and or run any global logic (usually to call functions)
*******This where stuff is actually happening

define any event listeners


We also learned about HTML Forms

Discussed Javascript events and event handler useage!!!!
