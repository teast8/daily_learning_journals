“Tell me and I forget Teach me and I remember. Involve me and I learn.”

Pair Programming Basics

Today the topic of discussion and lessons were about Functions. It was a great experience working out the functions with a partner(Pair Programming). I found this very helpful, Bronwyn my partner was able to help me understand some minor errors in my syntax and I was able to make the necessary corrections according to errors in my code(debugging).

We also learned about Function Scope, Function Declarations (Loads into memory - we give it variables), Function Calls or Innocation (causes code to execute).
