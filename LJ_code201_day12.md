# LJ Code 201 Day - 12

“Tell me and I forget Teach me and I remember. Involve me and I learn.”

Today in class Brian discussed Css.
It was awesome information, and rather simplistic in which the way that he explained it.

The css layout and the way things should follow on the page was also very helpful.

Understanding how containers work is one of the biggest things we should know when trying to effectively apply css to a page.

Container are in conjunction with HTML.

We should make our CSS mimic our HTML. Limit the amount of containers and work with more abstract concepts like float and positioning.

We also discussed display types:
inline
block
inline-block

We also went over positioning....
relative
absolute
fixed
static
inherit
