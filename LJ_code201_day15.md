# LJ Code 201 Day - 15

“Tell me and I forget Teach me and I remember. Involve me and I learn.”

Today in class we discussed advanced JS...

Prototype vs Inheritance
  -mostly related to objects

Scopes and Closures
  -Mostly related to functions

Pass by reference
  -Mostly related to variables

Context/this
  -Related to the context

Pass by reference by Pass by value
  -almost everything in js is stored by value (pass by value)

  -when assigning an object or array, which is the type of a object to a variable passing by reference, you're still dealing with the reference no matter how you store it...

A closure is a stateful function...
