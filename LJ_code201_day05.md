# LJ Code 201 Day - 5

“Tell me and I forget Teach me and I remember. Involve me and I learn.”

The main focus for day five was learning how Git Branching works. The lab exercise gave me a good handle on branching.

We also discussed what increment operators.

Js and syntax structure... Everything in Js is basically a statement. Statements end with semi-colons.    
if (Condition) {
  Code Block: tell computer stuff to do
}
The different data types:
Numeric
String
Booleans
