# LJ Code 201 Day - 16

“Tell me and I forget Teach me and I remember. Involve me and I learn.”

Today in class we worked on constructing our webpages and adding content to our webpages.
Adrian and I was in charge of developing the layout and building the pages for our game.

Lee and Sera worked on JS functions and writing out the story.
We put together  a great plan to effective tackle this project over the weekend, and hit all of our milestones.

We ran into trouble implementing a method to stick with in our game, however we were able to put together a plan to condense the way the code will be written.
