# LJ Code 201 Day - 7

“Tell me and I forget Teach me and I remember. Involve me and I learn.”

Today in class we learned about tables and how tables of structured.

Tables have rows and columns. They are structured using rows and data cells. You build HTML tables left to right, top to bottom.

We also worked on how to put this code in JS. This was done by using arrays, object constructors and for loops.
