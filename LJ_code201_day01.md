# LJ Code 201 Day - 1

“Tell me and I forget Teach me and I remember. Involve me and I learn.”

I learned about Version Control Systems.

Git is used to save and backup work, share code and collaborate on projects.

Collaboration I feel is the foundation to becoming a great coder. The team projects and getting different perspectives and ideas from peers will help me grow in this space (Code Review). Using analogies from sports I think will help me work efficiently with my team and classmate. Those same skills are transferable and the leadership skills that I acquired in the sports arena will also benefit me greatly.

How to be better learners as an adult? Endless cycle of learning… Staying current, the industry and code is constantly evolving.

Git and GitHub is difficult to understand but I know I will get in depth understanding in the next couple of days.  

The organization of Documents.

Creating directories and knowing how the directories are implemented is something I learned today.
