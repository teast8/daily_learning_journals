# LJ Code 201 Day - 11

“Tell me and I forget Teach me and I remember. Involve me and I learn.”

Today in class we discuss JS functions. The #1 rule to keep in mind is to remember never to repeat yourself....

Function Syntax

function name(attribute/parameter){
     code block;
};

This is a function declaration. It stores the function into the browser’s memory. In order to run the function, we must call that function.

Function call or invocation:
name();

Parameters operate like local variables within the function. When we define the input of a function, we give it parameters, which operate like variables within the function when we call the function.

When we pass in information for the function to operate with, we pass in arguments. Arguments can be changed, swapped in, replaced, in the code or in the console log. Arguments can be also be variables; you can pass the values in directly, as above, or by defining those values with variables.
